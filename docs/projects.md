Research on developing locomotion controllers with robustness and closed-loop stability certificates for legged robots, including both bipedal humanoids and quadrupeds. The project focuses on **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for centroidal dynamics with adaptive control techniques, validated on real hardware including the ergoCub humanoid and Aliengo quadruped.

**Key Technologies:** Centroidal MPC, Adaptive Control, Real-time Optimization, C++, Python, MATLAB

## Human Robot Interaction

<img src="../images/Collaborative_Walking_4.png" alt="Locomotion" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 300px; border: 2px solid currentColor;">

Research on validating the **ergoCub humanoid** for physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI), specifically in collaborative payload transport scenarios. The work demonstrates the robot's capacity to perform joint tasks, such as walking with a human partner while carrying a shared load, without explicit prior knowledge of the human's ergonomic model.

The control architecture extends robust locomotion frameworks with:
*   **Relative Distance Regulation:** Constraining the robot to maintain a fixed distance from the walking partner.
*   **Contact Maintenance:** Using Inverse Kinematics tasks to ensure stable grasping of the payload during motion.
*   **Ergonomic Validation:** Utilizing wearable technology (iFeel suit) to monitor human lower-back torque (L5S1) ensuring repeatable and safe interaction dynamics.

**Key Technologies:** pHRI, Inverse Kinematics, Wearable Sensors (iFeel), Ergonomic Analysis, C++, YARP

## Teleoperation of Robotic Avatars

<img src="../images/teleoperation.png" alt="Teleoperation" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 300px; border: 2px solid currentColor;">

Development of advanced teleoperation interfaces for robotic avatar systems, enabling intuitive control of humanoid robots through VR devices and specialized peripherals. This is a joint research initiative with **Honda R&D** on their avatar robot platform. The system provides real-time bilateral control with force feedback for both locomotion and manipulation tasks, successfully demonstrated on iCub, ergoCub, and Honda's avatar robot.

**Key Technologies:** VR Interfaces, C/C++ Real-time Control, YARP Middleware, Quadratic Programming, Walking Controllers

## PhD Thesis - Sampled-Data Nonlinear Control

<img src="../images/thesis.JPG" alt="PhD Thesis" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 300px; border: 2px solid currentColor;">

My doctoral research focused on sampled-data control approaches for systems where partial dynamics cancellation is required, with applications in robotics and control systems. The thesis presents novel sampled-data control techniques, stability analysis for hybrid systems, and experimental validation on real hardware.

**Thesis:** *A sampled-data approach in control problems involving partial dynamics cancellation*  
**Institutions:** University of Paris Saclay (France) & Sapienza University of Rome (Italy)
