**Research on stable MPC for legged robots**

![Locomotion](../images/locomotion.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on developing locomotion controllers with robustness and closed-loop stability certificates for legged robots, including both bipedal humanoids and quadrupeds.

## Key Features

- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for centroidal dynamics
- **Closed-loop stability guarantees** through adaptive control techniques  
- **Validated on real hardware:** ergoCub humanoid and Aliengo quadruped
- **Multi-language implementation:** C++, Python, MATLAB

## Technologies

- Centroidal MPC
- Adaptive control
- Real-time optimization
- C++, Python, MATLAB

## Results

The controller has been successfully validated on:

- **ergoCub** - IIT's humanoid robot for industrial environments
- **Aliengo** - Unitree's quadruped robot

Demonstrations include stable walking on uneven terrain and robust recovery from external disturbances.
