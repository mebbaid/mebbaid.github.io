Mohamed Elobaid is a Research Scientist with the Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division at **King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)** (since September 2025).

His research focuses on the **solution of complex control problems in robotics**, applying rigorous theoretical frameworks—specifically geometric and sampled-data control—to diverse electro-mechanical systems. While his background is deeply rooted in humanoid and quadrupedal locomotion, his current work spans **underwater vehicles, agricultural manipulators, and wheeled robotic platforms.**

Previously, he was a Postdoc Researcher at the **Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)** (2022–2025), where he led control design for avatar systems and legged robots, including a joint initiative with **Honda R&D**. He holds a cotutelle Ph.D. in Control Engineering (cum laude) from **Sapienza University of Rome** and **University of Paris Saclay**.

## Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of **Control Theory** and **Applied Robotics**, aiming to guarantee desireable control-theoretic properties and performance across different domains:

- **Advanced Robot Control:** Designing of optimization-based and geometric controllers for underactuated systems, including **bipedal, quadrupedal, and wheeled-humanoid** robots.
- **Sampled-Data & Geometric Control:** Addressing the theoretical challenges of digital implementation, ensuring that physical properties (stability, passivity) are preserved under sampling.
- **Human-Robot Systems:** Creating teleoperation interfaces (Telexistence) and human-aware planning for Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI).
- **Marine & Field Robotics:** Developing control architectures for **underwater towed intelligent vehicles**, ROVs, and **manipulators for automatic harvesting** in unstructured environments.

## Research Highlights & Contributions

**Locomotion & Whole-Body Control (IIT)**
- **Legged & Wheeled Systems:** Developed MPC-based controllers validated on the **ergoCub humanoid** (as well as its predecessor iCub3) and the **Aliengo quadruped**.
- **Robustness:** Formulated online Non-linear Centroidal MPC with closed-loop stability certificates.

**Avatar Systems & Teleoperation**
- **Telexistence:** Led technology transfer projects for robotic teleoperation and contributed to the **iCub3 avatar system** (featured in *Science Robotics*).
- **Haptic Feedback:** Designed immersive VR-based interfaces for whole-body retargeting.

**Human-Robot Interaction**
- **Safety & Ergonomics:** Finalist for the **IEEE ICRA Outstanding Paper on HRI** (2023) for work on ergonomic payload lifting and collision avoidance planning.
- **Human-aware motion planning** Developed vision-based collaborative walking planners for the ergoCub robot to carry payloads in collaboration with a human

**Marine & Agricultural Robotics (KAUST)**
